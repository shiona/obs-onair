sends commands over a network when it's recording or streaming. Built with

- Go to Tools->Scripts, go to Python Settings tab and set the install directory
- In the same window go to the Scripts tab, click the plus button and select the script file.
- Configure correctly with the ip and port of your device. If the settings are not visible, python settings are not set correctly.
